            <p>
                Riding to Ladakh had always been my dream. The vast landscapes, snow-covered passes, and the thrill of riding at high altitudes had a magnetic pull on me. In May 2025, that dream finally came true.

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                Preparing for a Ladakh ride is no joke. From getting my bike serviced to packing the right gear, it took me weeks. I ensured I had essentials like a first-aid kit, tool kit, waterproof gloves, and a power bank.

            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Starting from Ahmedabad to Delhi, then I took the Manali-Leh highway. Rohtang Pass welcomed me with snow and biting cold. By the time I reached Leh, I had crossed breathtaking landscapes – rivers, barren lands, and snowy mountains.

            <h2>Magical Moments</h2>
            <p>
                Pangong Lake was a highlight. Its serene blue waters with mountains in the background felt like a painting. Camping under the stars there is an experience I’ll never forget.

            <h2>Why You Should Do It</h2>
            <p>
                If you love biking and adventure, Ladakh is a must. It challenges you, teaches you patience, and rewards you with nature’s raw beauty. Just be prepared, respect local culture, and ride responsibly.
